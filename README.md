# change-wallpaper.pyw
A Python 3 script to change your desktop wallpaper. Works on Linux and Windows. Adds a caption showing the original filename. Can also change the lockscreen on your desktop (in Windows and LXDE). With a little setup, you can even get a rotating wallpaper on your phone.

See [here](change-wallpaper.md) for full manual and instructions. Contributions welcome.
